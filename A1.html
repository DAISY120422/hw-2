            But <b>everyday is different</b>.
            <br>
            Usually i wake up at <b>6.20</b> and do my morning routine. Which includes putting on my uniforms, eating my
            breskfast and so on. Then i go outside and wait for my school bus which arrives at <b>7 am</b>.
            <br>
            School starts at <b>8 am</b> and usually i have 8 classes.
            Our school has <b>after-school programm</b>. I go to <mark>volleyball</mark>, <mark>debating club</mark> and
